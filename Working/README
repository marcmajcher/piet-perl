Piet/Interpreter version 0.03
=============================

Piet is a programming language in which programs look like abstract
paintings. The language is named after Piet Mondrian, who pioneered
the field of geometric abstract art.  The language is fully described
at http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~mar/esoteric/piet.html.  A Piet
program is an image file, usually a gif, which uses a set of 20 colors
and the transitions between blocks of those colors to define a series
of instructions and program flow.  See the above URL for more details.

INSTALLATION

Since Piet is a visual language, an image parsing mechanism is 
required.  This module uses Image::Magick, so it would be to your
advantage to download, install, and test that module and its 
related stuff before trying to use this one.  I know, it's sort
of a pain in the ass, but then again, so is Piet.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

See the perldoc for complete usage instructions.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Image::Magick
